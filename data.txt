Y'all remain in the box while we step out of it
The crowd love it we do too we proud of it
We don't half ass nothing we come hard every time
Every beat every song every bar every line
It's so hard to define I don't know why y'all try
It can't be fathomed by the mind of a small fry
But you can take a lesson in that
Sit back, shut your trap while professionals rap
Ain't nobody spittin' tighter
Crowds are gettin' hyper
I been rippin' cyphers
Since y'all were shittin' diapers
You Little Tike bikers with training wheels on them
Y'all dogs paddling, we Navy Seals frogmen
In aqua fatigues
You are not in the league
You're a lesser breed
Follow the professor's lead
Smart people sit intent at their desk
But most of y'all dummies are content with F's
You little toddlers
Sheep flock followers
Deep cock swallowers
We pop thermometers
E drops the melancholy
He rocks ominous beat chops
The butcher from the methodic meat shop
Where you can buy sound by the pound
If you're clowning around then sit the fuck down
Homeboy this ain't amateur night
So keep your hands off the mic if you can't handle it right
Y'all remain in the box while we step out of it
The crowd love it we do too we proud of it
We don't half ass nothing we come hard every time
Every beat every song every bar every line
It's so hard to define I don't know why y'all try
It can't be fathomed by the mind of a small fry
But you can take a lesson in that
Sit back, shut your trap while professionals rap
When I sit down and write and recite for the mic I hold
Make sure my beats are loud and bold and Cold
187, that is my name, makin' it simple and plain
Here to rearrange and change
The things that I couldn't do in the past
Don't be surprised when you got a shotgun up your ass
Perpetrators, that one was just for you
I'm gonna leave ya in your seat remaining without a clue
Glued to my style like a fiend on coke
But if you say the wrong thing, I wash your mouth out with soap
Dope is not the answer
No, I'm not a Cancer
No, I'm not a hero or zero
But a Leo in stereo
And this is not a demo
And adjectives, I live the life, the given gift
Not who's first, second or third
Not he said or she said or what you heard, nerd
Cause when you live like that, your life is mangled
In other words your life is all tangled up
I'm not a sucker, always go for mine
Powerlord that's hard from the start, and he will always (climb)
To the top as high as he can achieve
Sometimes that's even higher than the others believe
I'm not a doctor, not a poet, I don't have a degree
Not arrogant, egotistical, I'm the epitome
We take recon, these suckas are lying
Transform into another world as I recite these rhymes
187, he's as hard as it comes
And I don't have to brag
About the size of my gun, son
